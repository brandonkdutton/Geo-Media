# Geo-Media
A Location based message board to encourage you to go new places. Full stack, responsive, mobile friendly. 

Whenever you visit somewhere new you can create the first post for that area. People who visit that area can then comment or make their own posts. You can view posts from anywhere, but can only post to locations within 25 miles of where you are at the time.

This is a work in progess. It works, but there are a few bugs and features that have yet to be implemented.
